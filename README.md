Last week and this week, Mojang announced a new feature for 1.21, small but in need of an addition, in this case: more frame options for the game, which will celebrate 15 years of existence in a few weeks. Thinking about the old versions that won't have this little feature present, I created a mod that adds these frames to the game.
